# How to use

In order to use the theme, you must have a CSS injector in order to get Discord to load it. Here's a list of recommended
injectors.
- [BeautifulDiscord](https://github.com/leovoel/BeautifulDiscord)
- [Powercord](https://github.com/powercord-org/powercord) (Canary only!)

Once you get that setup, you must navigate to the stylesheet that the injector created and copy the contents from
the [`import.css`](https://github.com/Equity/Purplous/blob/master/import.css) in this repository.
