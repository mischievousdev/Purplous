# Installation

You must use an injector such as [BeautifulDiscord](https://github.com/leovoel/BeautifulDiscord) 
or [Powercord](https://github.com/powercord-org/powercord) to actually get it to work. 

Once you get it working, you must navigate to the `import.css` file and copy it to your stylesheet. This allows
you to receive automatic updates without needing to manually copy and paste the CSS on each update.
